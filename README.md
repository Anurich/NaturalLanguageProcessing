<p> Hello Everyone I have Made a simple program which help us to classify language , so for  example : if i say my name is Anupam , the model will predict it as english </p>

<b> How do i did it ?</b>
<p> Its very simple and easy first time it might look difficult but if u think in bith depth it will started making sense to you </p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the Data i have provided the file which has ['eng','spn','itl','due'] language its a file with full of text</li>
  <li>we need to preprocess the data what i did in the file is i remove the digits , i only consider word which is more than 2 in length , i perform the stemming and i seprate the label with the text </li>
  <li> Than i put the data into the data frame because if u see it in dataframe its easy to understand what u actually need to do</li>
  <li> so my data is [TEXT,LABEL] for every text i have label </li>
</ul>
